      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../../../img/cerini.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;passion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 8 years old when I started playing guitar. It was not my choice, though, but my parents’ who forced me to start taking some lessons. I hated it at the beginning: hours of solfège, and I wasn’t even able to play the most stupid song. No chords, nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I had some natural talent for music (I’m gifted with the so called musical ear. And so my brother and sister are - the Force is strong in my family), and maybe my parents knew that and that’s why they persisted so much with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time passed and I learned chords and arpeggios. I actually became so good until the point where my teacher told me that I was his most successful student ever, and he didn’t have anything more to teach me. He suggested me to go to the conservatory, but it was too much of an engagement both for me and for my parents and so I quite taking lessons.
I remember I felt relieved. No more lessons, no more waste of my precious time (1 hour / week &amp;hellip;). I could spend that hour playing football with my friends. So I quit playing guitar in general.
I was 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t touch my guitar for about 7 years, until a summer when I made a new friend. He was (he still is) an extraordinary guitarist, and he was able to reproduce all the songs he knew just listening to them for few minutes. He was always the coolest guy of the party. And he was/is also an extremely nice and funny guy. I loved the way he played his guitar, and his passion was so contagious that he made me willing to take mine and start playing again. During those few weeks my passion came back with all its strength. I started to learn new chords, find new ones and I soon realized that I was not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My passion was driving me to a new level of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt; and I found some things to be easier than I thought years before. &lt;strong&gt;My friend’s passion has triggered mine&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve been playing guitar no-stop for years since then, and I improved so much. I own two guitars now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love photography. I started to take photos when I first came here in south of France from Italy. The scenery was beautiful and so I thought to buy my first DSLR (a Nikon D70s). When I started using it I was very bad, I wasn’t even able to take a good photo in normal conditions and all those gears were difficult to manage. After some months with no improvements I gave up. I didn’t use my Nikon for about a year until I registered to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://kelbyone.com/&#34;&gt;online course&lt;/a&gt; where I discovered the post-processing. I was hooked. I discovered a new entire world of possibilities and so I started to improve my photos in order to apply all those cools things I was looking on the web. Then I tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://strobist.blogspot.fr/2011/01/introducing-strobist-lighting-in-layers.html&#34;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt;, and in one year I hugely improved my skills and now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/alebaffa/&#34;&gt;I’m not so bad&lt;/a&gt;. Again, something that has brought my passion back to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with passion and optimism is one of the best things you can do to improve yourself and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the reason why I started to go to conferences: once back home you’re so full of enthusiasm that you restart whatever you do with a new energy.
It’s the reason why I started to co-organize a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/French-Riviera-Software-Craftsmanship-Community/&#34;&gt;local Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s also the reason why I like being a developer advocate, because I meet and work with so many passionate people who trigger my passion and pro-activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being surrounded by passionate people can speed up your learning process by giving you that amount of motivation that you sometime may lose on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve been at the dotGo conference in Paris, the European conference about the Go programming language. Quick summary: &lt;strong&gt;fantastic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the second time I participate (I’ve been there also last year, 2014) and I found exactly the same impeccable organization, a beautiful location (with lots of food..), a great ambiance, and the talks, as usual, have been extremely interesting, inspiring and cool. Some of them (not in the same order of the conference):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, you want to finally release your &lt;em&gt;preciousss&lt;/em&gt; written in Go to the open source community. Great! And thank you.
Though, there are few things you may want to consider before doing the big step. Things that you may have missed perhaps because you are not yet 100% comfortable with Go (but “_I will improve later. Now let me just put this gem on Github._”).
You have to know that the Go community can be quite strict when it comes to its idioms and conventions. And they are right, in my opinion. So, in order to avoid hundred of issues and pull requests on Github focused mainly on code style and best practices, and not on the real core of your project, check these following few things before pushing your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-sure-you-read-effective-go:4d0de480b34d2f2804a1a5f468baab59&#34;&gt;Be sure you read Effective Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html&#34;&gt;Effective Go&lt;/a&gt; contains all the tips you need to know in order to write clear and idiomatic Go code. You will learn all the best practices and the conventions used and followed by the Go community.
Effective Go is essential not only for newbies programmers, but also (and foremost) for those coming from other programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go is unlikely to produce a satisfactory result — Java programs are written in Java, not Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoid-common-mistakes:4d0de480b34d2f2804a1a5f468baab59&#34;&gt;Avoid common mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go community over the years has identified some common mistakes made in Go projects, and so common comments in the code reviews. These comments are now collected in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments&#34;&gt;Go Code Review Comments&lt;/a&gt; page.
Be sure not to make these common mistakes yourself, so give a read to that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-all-the-tools:4d0de480b34d2f2804a1a5f468baab59&#34;&gt;Use all the tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go comes with some amazing tools that allow you to write idiomatic Go with less effort. Be sure to check all your code with, at least, these few ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/&#34;&gt;gofmt&lt;/a&gt;: to automatically formats Go source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/lint&#34;&gt;golint&lt;/a&gt;: to print out code style mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/cmd/vet/&#34;&gt;govet&lt;/a&gt;: to examine the code and report suspicious constructs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by using at least these 3 tools you can manage to write clear and idiomatic Go code and avoid a lot of issues and pull requests. And they also help you to learn Go in the proper way :) .
&lt;strong&gt;Good news&lt;/strong&gt;. The Go community is so good that there are plugins for the most used IDE: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime&#34;&gt;GoSublime&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/beta-testers-wanted-sublimetext-go/1282&#34;&gt;official Google plugin&lt;/a&gt; (in test) for SublimeText, &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io/packages/go-plus&#34;&gt;GoPlus&lt;/a&gt; for Atom, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fatih/vim-go&#34;&gt;vim-go&lt;/a&gt; for Vim and, incredibly enough, VisualStudio has a lot of good reviews for Go.
There are a lot of other IDE, but these ones, apparently, are the most used ones by the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stay-up-to-date-with-the-go-development:4d0de480b34d2f2804a1a5f468baab59&#34;&gt;Stay up-to-date with the Go development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are open sourcing a Go project chances are that you may be impacted by changes in the Go libraries, or whatever can happen with the development of Go in general. It’s better to stay up-to-date with what happens and follow the discussions on these Google Groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-dev&#34;&gt;golang-dev&lt;/a&gt;: discussions of the development of the Go project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts&#34;&gt;golang-nuts&lt;/a&gt;: general discussion list for the Go Programming Language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-part-of-the-community:4d0de480b34d2f2804a1a5f468baab59&#34;&gt;Be part of the community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go community is super active. Just go &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki#the-go-community&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to choose how you want to follow it. It’s important to follow the discussions if you’re seriously working with Go, you may discover useful things, or you could get to know important developments or projects that can impact your work.
And don’t forget the &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/conduct&#34;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good! Now that you know what to check .. just to do it and let us know when your preciousss will be available for us to enjoy! :)&lt;/p&gt;
